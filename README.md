# YouToo

In today’s world, networking is very important. The whole world relies on networking. There are several networking applications which are available on the Google play market but not many solve the primary issue faced by all android users – communicating and meeting up with people who share the same interests as you. 

 It is always easiest to start networking with the people to whom you are closest: friends, family, neighbors, present and former co-workers/employers, faculty, classmates, and anyone else with whom you have frequent contact. However, it is difficult to start networking with unknown people. The main problem is people hesitate to start a conversation with random people. For this there has to be a way for finding like-minded people, people who share the same interests as you. This will ease the networking process.
 
Also face-to-face conversation is any day more effective than online networking. None of the existing applications provides the location details of people nearby your location and who share the same interest as you.
